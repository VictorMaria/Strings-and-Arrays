# Strings-and-Arrays

#### Recreating a C or C++ experience by pretending some JavaScript string and array methods don't exist and writing them from scratch with minimal or no dependency on inbuilt methods.

## How to use the code
Clone the repository ```git clone https://github.com/VictorMaria/Strings-and-Arrays.git```

Navigate into the newly created folder for the code ```cd Strings-and-Arrays```

Install dependencies ```npm install```

To run the tests, ```npm run build``` then ```npm run test```

Navigate into playground.ts file, instantiate an object of the class you want to use and also call the methods you want on your instance,
console log the result then do ```npm run play``` to view the output on the console.
